		<p>As one of the first members of our private beta, there were many issues that had to be addressed regarding our client. Katie worked together with our team to go through all sixty of her characters to help us find any items or values that were causing saving to fail. Thankfully because of her and Maryse, our client is functioning wonderfully now.</p>
