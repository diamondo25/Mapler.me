			<li>
				<h3>What is Mapler.me?</h3>
				<p>Mapler.me is a social network dedicated to MapleStory that allows players to interact with other maplers, track your character's progress, and control your Maple "Story".</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>How long has Mapler.me been around for?</h3>
				<p>Mapler.me was first released in February 2013 as a private beta.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>How many players currently use Mapler.me?</h3>
				<p>Mapler.me currently has over five hundred maplers registered, and hundreds of characters added to the Mapler.me network.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Is this site real and will I be hacked if I use it?</h3>
				<p>Absolutely not! Mapler.me is trusted by hundreds of maplers and we ensure all character information is stored safely and that everything is secure.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Is Mapler.me endorsed or affiliated with MapleStory / Nexon America?</h3>
				<p>Mapler.me is currently not endorsed with Nexon America, although we follow many regulations that are required for our service to exist. We are obligated to provide complete transparency to Nexon America as mentioned in our Terms of Service.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Why do we have to download a client? Can you just add our characters yourself?</h3>
				<p>When you connect a Nexon America account, your password and other information are not stored which does not allow us to add characters automatically. Your privacy is very important, and we cannot assume every player wants all of their characters added.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>How does your client work and is it safe?</h3>
				<p>Our client was created with players in mind to provide an effortless way to add and manage your character. Our client functions without interacting with MapleStory and instead monitors incoming traffic to find character information. All information is then encrypted and safely sent to Mapler.me!</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>The client crashes when I start it up, help?</h3>
				<p>Sometimes our client can encounter an issue that only one person encounters. If you're unable to use our client or experience any other issues let us know by sending a support ticket!</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Do I have to connect a Nexon America account / add characters to use Mapler.me?</h3>
				<p>Mapler.me works perfectly without adding your characters although you'll miss out on the awesome features it has to offer!</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Why do we have to connect our Nexon Account to Mapler.me? This seems suspicious!</h3>
				<p>First off, we're glad you're protective of your account and it's normal to be! Mapler.me's servers monitor dozens to hundreds of characters every second all working and relaying updates to the site in real-time. To make sure your character knows you're its owner, it checks to see if it's account is on Mapler.me. This ensures that all information is properly stored and that other players can't claim them!</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>I connected my account but I don't see my characters on Mapler.me!</h3>
				<p>As mentioned in our Terms of Service, we take privacy very seriously. We require players to manually add characters as we do not store Nexon America account details for your security.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>I don't want anyone to be able to see my character nor it's equips, is there an option to hide it?</h3>
				<p>To change character privacy options, view your Settings panel then click on Characters. Options to change individual characters are found on this page as well as other configurations.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Where can I control the settings for each character I have on Mapler.me?</h3>
				<p>You can set privacy, emotions, and other settings for each character by going to the Characters tab in your Settings panel.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Something about my character isn't accurate or my avatar is broken!</h3>
				<p>Let a staff member know by mentioning them in a status, or send a support ticket if it's confidential.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>There isn't an option to delete a character, how can I do this?</h3>
				<p>There currently isn't an option to delete characters yourself, although you can request for a staff member to delete one by telling us it's name, or sending a support ticket if it's a hidden or confidential character.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>One of my statuses was deleted and it wasn't me. What happened?</h3>
				<p>Any status updates that break our Terms of Service are subject to be removed by moderators or our team. Repeated abuse through statuses can lead to account restrictions.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>If I'm banned on Mapler.me, what happens to all my characters I have added?</h3>
				<p>It is your responsibility to abide by our rules. If your account is permanently banned from Mapler.me all characters and accounts currently connected will remain as-is.</p>
