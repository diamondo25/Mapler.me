[Mapler.me Instructions]

Hello and thank you for testing out Mapler.me during it's Beta!
We will eventually create a normal installer instead of just a folder.

----

To run Mapler.me, simply start MaplerMe.exe!

When you first launch the program, two items will be created:
- A 'logs' folder
- cached_keys.txt

The logs contain absolutely no confidential information (and are fully viewable)
and contain how Mapler.me connected to our servers. In the case there is an issue,
these can help assist us to find the cause.

The document cached_keys.txt contains configurations that Mapler.me uses to
correctly monitor MapleStory without interupting your service.
This may change from time to time depending on updates and MapleStory versions.
This file is only used if the client fails to connect to the servers. (fallback)

---

AHA.dll contains a majority of the scripting used by Mapler.me's client.
PacketDotNet.dll transcribes all data from Mapler.me and prepares it.
SharpPcap.dll then transfers the data after encrypting it.

If you have any questions or need clarification, please let us know!
